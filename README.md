Lab: Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, and KNN

This lab explores the Smarket dataset from the ISLP library, which includes percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index over 1,250 days between 2001 and 2005. The dataset provides features such as the percentage returns for the five previous trading days (Lag1 through Lag5), trading volume (in billions), the return on the current day (Today), and market direction (Up or Down). By analyzing this data, we will apply methods like Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to model and predict market movements.
